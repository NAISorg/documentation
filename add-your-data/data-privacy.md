# Data privacy

[ Read about Market View's AI features and the privacy rules governing the data used there.](../comparisons/ai-and-data-privacy.md)

### Data access

Permission to sync or upload your admission data is granted by you or your school. Data refreshes needs to be triggered by you or your school. Market View will not sync data without your initiation, each data sync will need to be triggered manually by you or someone else at your school.&#x20;

### Encryption in transit

Market View encrypts all of its traffic. This includes data flowing between Market View and your admission software. It also includes traffic between Market View's backend and frontend. We are using exclusively https to transfer data, with SSL encryption with SHA-256. This is bank-level security. Market View receives an A+ on[ SSL reports](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=marketview.nais.org\&hideResults=on\&latest).

In addition, NAIS enforces HSTS, HTTP Strict Transport Security. This means that all NAIS domains and subdomains deny any unencrypted traffic. We are registered with Chrome, Firefox, and Edge as enforcing HSTS.&#x20;

### Encryption at rest

Market View has taken the additional step to encrypt all student and school data within our database. This is above the usual standard of security, but we felt it was important to protect the data with which you are entrusting us. We are using encryption that features random initialization vectors and tagged ciphertexts.

### Security audits

NAIS has conducted security audits with an outside cybersecurity firm to review compliance with proper security protocols and standards.

### User access

The only users with access to Market View are paid NAIS members and premium subscribers. Your data is only accessible to users who have accounts within your school and to NAIS for debugging and analysis purposes.[ If you are curious about who has an account with your school, visit the member portal and click roster. ](https://sso.nais.org/sso/login?appCode=Portal\&returnUrl=https:%2F%2Fmy.nais.org%2Fs%2F)
