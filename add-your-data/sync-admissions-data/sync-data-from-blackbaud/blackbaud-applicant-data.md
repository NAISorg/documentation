# Blackbaud applicant data

In Blackbaud, each student has a status. Blackbaud data doesn't have a definitive marker for "applicant", applicants fall under "inquiries" in the system.

In order to sync your applicants from Blackbaud, Market View looks for statuses that have “applicant” in the name, plus any statuses that could have an applicant status as a parent status.

This usually excludes the inquiry statuses, since students usually can’t progress from “applicant” status to “inquiry”, but it depends on how a school sets up their statuses.

If you are missing students from your "applicants" list in Market View, change their status or parent status to include the word "applicant". Then refresh your data and you should see them included.&#x20;

If you have questions about your applicant data, please get in touch.&#x20;
