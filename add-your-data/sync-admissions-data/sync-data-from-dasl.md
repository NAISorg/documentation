# Sync data from DASL

## Importing DASL data

Market View offers the ability to sync selected admission data from DASL.

In order to begin the sync, visit the[ DASL Data page under Your Data.](https://marketview.nais.org/your-data/dasl) You'll see a button that says "Refresh" or "Sync". Once you click the button, Market View will begin importing selected admission data.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that Market View will never import or sync data without your knowledge. Every data import from DASL or other sources needs to be initiated by clicking the "Refresh" or "Sync" button.
{% endhint %}

You'll see a notification at the bottom of your screen when the import is complete. Visit the [DASL data page](https://marketview.nais.org/your-data/dasl) in Market View to see what was synced.

## Editing DASL data

If there is a conflict between the data you uploaded to Market View and the data you input into DASL, you'll see an icon with red crossed arrows. When you click that symbol, it will tell you which numbers are a mismatch. In the example below, you uploaded 232 for that variable, but you entered 89 into DASL. You cannot edit DASL data in Market View, but there is a handy link for you to edit each variable in DASL. "Edit on DASL" is the hyperlink you can click to fix DASL numbers. It will bring you directly to the exact cell you can edit.

If the numbers are **black** and not red, that means there is no conflict between Market View and DASL.&#x20;

If the Market View numbers are wrong, head to the [Admission Data page](https://marketview.nais.org/your-data) to adjust the counts for each bucket by deleting or adding spreadsheets, or importing from your admissions tool.&#x20;

## Viewing DASL data in Market View

Once you've imported your DASL data and everything looks good, you can head to [Trends > Enrollment Trends](https://marketview.nais.org/trends/enrollment/trends) to see your DASL data in action. All four of the charts on this tab include DASL data.

The national averages included in these charts are the national average for schools entering data into DASL.
