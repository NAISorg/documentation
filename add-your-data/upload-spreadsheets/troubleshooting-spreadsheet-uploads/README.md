# Troubleshooting spreadsheet uploads

* [ ] The template you have chosen ([miscellaneous data](https://nais.gitbook.io/nais/add-your-data/upload-data-from-spreadsheets#upload-miscellaneous-data) or [student data](https://nais.gitbook.io/nais/add-your-data/upload-data-from-spreadsheets#upload-student-applications)) matches the section to which you are uploading data (miscellaneous data or student)
* [ ] The file is a .csv file extension
* [ ] The file is UTF-8 encoded[ <mark style="color:blue;">(click here for instructions)</mark> ](encode-files-correctly.md)
* [ ] The file has the correct headers (First name, Last name, Address, ID, Grade). Schools sometimes use "student ID" but the column needs to be "ID".&#x20;
