# View your data in Market View

There are three places your school's data appears in Market View: the map in Map View, the ZIP code detail cards also in Map View, and charts of your data display in the Enrollment section of the Trends page.

## View your data on the map

* [ ] Visit [Map View](https://marketview.nais.org/map)
* [ ] Click "Show me the results"
* [ ] Click the layer selector in the upper right corner and you'll see each of your data sets with a checkbox next to it.&#x20;
* [ ] Click the checkbox to hide or show the data set. Note that the color of the icon matches the color of the pins on the map.

Your data is grouped into two categories in the layer selector panel, Admissions Data and Enrollment Data. Those two categories reflect the two categories of data you can add in the Your Data page.

## View your data in ZIP code cards

If you want a more granular view of your data, check out the ZIP code cards in the left sidebar of the Map View. Every single ZIP code card will include your data, if you've uploaded it.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that ZIP code cards are small and so they only include the most recent two years of data for Admission Data. If you want to get around this limitation, feel free to upload your data as Miscellaneous Data. It won't be considered Admissions Data, so you won't get all the calculations and charts, but it's a workaround to get older data to still show on the map.
{% endhint %}

You'll see two groups: Admissions Data and Miscelleneous Data. Those reflect the two categories of data you can add in the Your Data page.

You'll also get calculations for your Admissions Data for the most recent two years. Total applicants, the percent of your applications which came from this ZIP, and the percent of school-age children from this ZIP who applied to your school.
