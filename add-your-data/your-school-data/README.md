# Your school data

There are two types of data you can add to Market View, student and miscellaneous.

{% hint style="info" %}
There are two **types** of data you can add to Market View, student and miscellaneous.\
There are two **ways** to upload data, [by spreadsheet](../upload-spreadsheets/upload-data-from-spreadsheets.md) and by [admission data sync](../sync-admissions-data/).
{% endhint %}

## Student data

Student data can be either applicants or enrolled students. You can include up to five data points about each student.

1. First name
2. Last name
3. Grade
4. ID
5. Address

You can upload student data via [spreadsheet](../upload-spreadsheets/upload-data-from-spreadsheets.md), [Blackbaud data sync](../sync-admissions-data/sync-data-from-blackbaud/), or [Veracross data sync](../sync-admissions-data/sync-data-from-veracross/).

If you don't want to include any of the above fields, due to privacy concerns or other reasons, feel free to omit them. The importer will work with all columns blank except for address. If you don't want to add addresses either, you can pare it down to just ZIP codes.

## Miscellaneous data

Miscellaneous data can be teacher addresses, bus stops, feeder schools, any data source that you find helpful. You can only upload addresses for this type of data.

[You can upload miscellaneous data via spreadsheet](https://nais.gitbook.io/nais/add-your-data/spreadsheet-uploads/upload-data-from-spreadsheets#upload-miscellaneous-data).
