# AI & Data Privacy

Market View uses OpenAI to generate the insights we show you about your data on the [Comparisons page](https://marketview.nais.org/comparisons).

**Which data is involved?**

Market View sends [25 of your DASL datapoints](https://docs.marketview.nais.org/nais/comparisons/data-used-in-comparisons) related to financial aid. We are not sending any of your data with words in it, so no school names, other names, etc. Only a select list of numbers are shared in passing with OpenAI to generate insights.&#x20;

**What services are used?**

We are using OpenAI's API. We are not using ChatGPT.  We send OpenAI a list of numbers and ask it to generate an insight, which we then display on the screen to you.

**Which information is being sent to OpenAI?**
