# AI & Data Privacy

Market View uses OpenAI to generate the insights we show you about your data on the [Comparisons page](https://marketview.nais.org/comparisons).

**Which data is involved?**

Market View sends [25 of your DASL datapoints](https://docs.marketview.nais.org/nais/comparisons/data-used-in-comparisons) related to financial aid. We are not sending any of your data with words in it, so no school names, other names, etc. Only a select list of numbers are shared temporarily with OpenAI to generate insights.&#x20;

**What services are used?**

We are using OpenAI's API. We are not using ChatGPT.  We send OpenAI a list of numbers and ask it to generate an insight, which we then display on the screen to you.

**Does OpenAI use my data to train its models?**

No.&#x20;

From OpenAI: [We do not train our models on your business data by default.](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] [Unless they explicitly opt-in, organizations are opted out of data-sharing by default](#user-content-fn-2)[^2].

**Does OpenAI retain my data?**

Yes, for thirty days.&#x20;

From OpenAI: [OpenAI may securely retain API inputs and outputs for up to 30 days to identify abuse.](#user-content-fn-3)[^3]

**How can I learn more?**

[Read more at OpenAI's Enterprise privacy document.](https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy/) Please note that this is different than their ChatGPT offering, ChatGPT is much less private.

**Can I opt-out of Market View Comparisons?**

Yes. If you would like us to refrain from having OpenAI analyze the 25 DASL variables used by Comparisons, just let us know and we will exclude you. Email wilkinson@nais.org to opt-out.
