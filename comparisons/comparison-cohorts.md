# Comparison Cohorts

Schools can be grouped into two important types of groups: "peers" and "neighbors."

* **Nationwide schools like me** are made by looking at schools that are similar in certain ways, like the type of school, the number of students, the grades they offer, and the income of the nearby area. Schools that are alike in these ways get grouped together into a certain number of peer groups.
* **Local neighbor groups** are made up of schools that are close to each other and offer similar grades. Each school has its own group of nearby neighbors.

When we want to compare schools, we look at different statistics or numbers (like enrollment, tuition, or financial aid). These statistics can be calculated for individual schools or for the whole group of schools in a peer or neighbor group.

A **comparison** is when we take one of these statistics and look at how it changes over time for a school and its peer and neighbor groups. For example, we might compare how a school’s enrollment has changed over the past few years with its peers and neighbors. The comparison also comes with a title and a short summary that explains what we’re looking at.

Sometimes, the data for a school or group might be missing. This can happen if the school didn’t provide the needed information, or if there aren’t enough similar schools to create a good comparison.

Schools, groups, and their comparisons all depend on data that gets updated regularly. When new data is added or old data is changed, the statistics and comparisons are recalculated to keep everything up to date.
