### American Community Survey (ACS)

The **American Community Survey** (**ACS**) is a demographics survey program conducted by the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S.\_Census\_Bureau). It regularly gathers information previously contained only in the long form of the [decennial census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United\_States\_Census), such as ancestry, citizenship, educational attainment, income, language proficiency, migration, [disability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability\_in\_the\_United\_States), employment, and housing characteristics. These data are used by many [public-sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public\_sector), [private-sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private\_sector), and not-for-profit stakeholders to allocate funding, track shifting demographics, plan for emergencies, and learn about local communities.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American\_Community\_Survey#cite\_note-1) Sent to approximately 295,000 addresses monthly (or 3.5 million per year), it is the largest household survey that the Census Bureau administers.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American\_Community\_Survey#cite\_note-:1-2)

### Children of Color

For Market View, "Children of Color" or "Students of Color" are children aged 0-17 who do not identify as white. We acknowledge that this definition is lacking and problematic but unfortunately we are working from the Census data and have to work within its established categories.

For Market View's purposes "children of color" equals the total amount of children minus white/non-hispanic children.&#x20;

### Choropleth&#x20;

Pronounced "core-o-pleth".&#x20;

A **choropleth map** (from [Greek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek\_language) χῶρος _(choros)_ 'area/region', and πλῆθος _(plethos)_ 'multitude') is a type of statistical [thematic map](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thematic\_map) that uses [pseudocolor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocolor), i.e., [color](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color) corresponding with an aggregate summary of a geographic characteristic within spatial enumeration units.

People often confuse a choropleth map for a [heatmap.](glossary.md#undefined) Market View does not contain heatmaps. Choropleths have distinct geographical boundaries for each color, whereas heatmaps show gradual color changes.

### Easy Analytic Software (EASI)

EASI is a New York-based demographics data solutions and statistical estimating firm that specializes in consumer demographics. EASI takes public data, and provides it to NAIS along with their own projections.&#x20;

### Family

A family is a group of two people or more (one of whom is the householder) related by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together; all such people (including related subfamily members) are considered as members of one family.&#x20;

### Heatmap

A **heat map** (or **heatmap**) is a [data visualization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data\_visualization) technique that shows magnitude of a phenomenon as color in two dimensions. The variation in color may be by [hue](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hue) or [intensity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brightness), giving obvious visual cues to the reader about how the phenomenon is clustered or varies over space.

### Household

A household consists of all the people who occupy a housing unit. A house, an apartment or other group of rooms, or a single room, is regarded as a housing unit when it is occupied or intended for occupancy as separate living quarters; that is, when the occupants do not live with any other persons in the structure and there is direct access from the outside or through a common hall.

A household includes the related family members and all the unrelated people, if any, such as lodgers, foster children, wards, or employees who share the housing unit. A person living alone in a housing unit, or a group of unrelated people sharing a housing unit such as partners or roomers, is also counted as a household. The count of households excludes group quarters.

### Isochrone&#x20;

An **isochrone map** in [geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography) and [urban planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban\_planning) is a map that depicts the area accessible from a point within a certain time threshold. An [isochrone](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/isochrone) (iso = equal, chrone = time) is defined as "a line drawn on a map connecting points at which something occurs or arrives at the same time".

### Median income

The **median income** is the [income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income) amount that divides a population into two equal groups, half having an income above that amount, and half having an income below that amount. It may differ from the [mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean) (or [average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average)) income. The income that occurs most frequently is the income [mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode\_\(statistics\)).

### Saturation

Market View uses this formula to calculate saturation: A school's enrollment in a given ZIP, divided by the total school age population in that ZIP.

### Travel time

Market View uses Mapbox to calculate travel times.

Traffic Data speed predictions are calculated using the 300 million miles of de-identified location data collected daily from mobile devices running Mapbox-powered apps.
