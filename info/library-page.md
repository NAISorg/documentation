# "Library" page

Market View had a "Library" feature, which were bookmarks, links to the URLs to your reports. The feature was not used often, so we deprecated this feature. \

You can copy this functionality by using your browser bookmarks. When you get the location and parameters to a map you like, bookmark it in your browser to be able to quickly return to it.

Note: neither Library bookmarks nor browser bookmarks preserve your layer selections, only your location and parameters set in the query paragrah.
