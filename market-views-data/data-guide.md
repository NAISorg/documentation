#### Population by Age Band: EASI Demographics <a href="#populationbyage" id="populationbyage"></a>

What is it?

EASI provides population estimates by age band (0-4,5-9, etc.) for the current year. These estimates are created using the 2020 census numbers, American Community Survey Data, and Public Use Microdata Survey. To calculate projections, EASI uses the estimates above as a starting point and applies population component change estimates (births, deaths, migration, etc.) to move that number forward. [Read the full methodology here.](https://www.easidemographics.com/about/easiMethods.asp)

How do we use it?

EASI’s age band estimates are used to provide an approximation of the school-age population of a single-year age across ZIP codes. These estimates are then combined with mapping technology supplied by Mapbox (described below) to generate the customizable map that you see within Market View.

#### Family Income, EASI Demographics <a href="#familyincome" id="familyincome"></a>

What is it?

EASI’s income model builds on a base estimate created using 2020 census data and estimates from the American Community Survey. EASI creates estimates from here by using consumer income survey data provided by the census (P60 Publication Series) and other sources of income data. Differences between the estimates provided from these data and the ACS values are analyzed to provide a final estimate. Income estimates use the 2020 census household definition of income as a benchmark. [Read the full methodology here.](https://www.easidemographics.com/about/easiMethods.asp)

How do we use it?

EASI’s median income estimates provide an economic snapshot of the various areas in your local community. EASI’s estimates of median family income can be used to get a sense of the wealth distribution of your area, or to see how affordable your school is for a typical family in your community.

#### Population by Sex by Race/Ethnicity, EASI Demographics <a href="#populationbysex" id="populationbysex"></a>

What is it?

EASI also provides population estimates by sex and race/ethnicity for age bands in the current year. EASI uses annual estimates released by the census as the basis for their population by sex by race/ethnicity data. To calculate projections, EASI uses the census estimate as a starting point and applies population component change estimates (births, deaths, migration, etc.) to move that number forward. [Read the full methodology here.](https://www.easidemographics.com/about/easiMethods.asp)

How do we use it?

EASI’s estimates for population by race/ethnicity provide schools with a fuller picture of the diversity of their local student population. These estimates are useful for schools seeking to understand how the racial and ethnic diversity of their student body compares to the local population. In addition, EASI’s estimates for population by sex provide more flexibility for single sex schools and other schools seeking to understand local differences in male and female populations. Note that Market View does not currently contain data on gender, as the underlying sources of data (EASI and the Census Bureau) do not currently collect this data.

#### Drive-Time Area, Mapbox Navigation Service <a href="#drivetime" id="drivetime"></a>

What is it?

Mapbox’s traffic tilesets provide drivetime information, or the time it takes to get from point A to point B, to their maps. Mapbox bases its drivetime estimates on travel data that is transmitted from users of apps embedded with Mapbox technology, such as Airbnb, Instacart, and Snapchat. This data, which consists of over 220 million miles of travel per day, is used to predict and extrapolate real-time traffic, helping to further improve the accuracy of drivetimes. [Read the full methodology here.](https://www.mapbox.com/telemetry/)

How do we use it?

We heard from members that time, not distance, is the most important metric in measuring a commute. As opposed to simply measuring distance, drivetimes provide a more comprehensive understanding of how conveniently located your school is for families in the area. In addition, Mapbox’s traffic control features provide a realistic understanding of the time it will take families to reach your school during typical commuting hours.

#### Five-year Data Projections, EASI Demographics <a href="#projections" id="projections"></a>

What is it?

EASI demographics provides five year projections for the population and income variables described above. These projections use EASI’s current year estimates as a starting point, and apply growth models to obtain a five year projection. The models incorporate factors such as births, deaths, and migration to obtain population projections, and build on data from the American Community Survey and Census Consumer Income Survey to obtain income projections. [Read the full methodology here.](https://www.easidemographics.com/about/easiMethods.asp)

How do we use it?

EASI’s projections are a great way to get a sense of how your local area will be changing over the next several years. While projections are not often 100 percent accurate, they are a great starting point to see trends and begin conversations around how the school-age population, demographics, and income profile of your area are changing.

#### Public and Private School Data, National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) <a href="#publicandprivateschool" id="publicandprivateschool"></a>

What is it?

The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) provides data on public and private schools, which is gathered through its universe surveys each year. The surveys provide data on many schools across the United States, including basic descriptive information such as location, web address, and grade levels served.

How do we use it?

NCES’s school data is uploaded into Market View’s map, so you can see other schools in your area. Each school is represented by a black circle on your map. Clicking the circle will provide the school’s name, type (Public/Private), website (where available), and grade levels served.

#### Affordability Data <a href="#affordability" id="affordability"></a>

What is it?

NAIS uses data provided by Community Brands’ School and Student Services (SSS) financial aid service which analyzes applications for families across the country. Using the family income and parent contribution data from submitted applications, we calculate the median percentage of income that parents are asked to contribute to school costs by income bands. The contribution is subtracted from the tuition entered by the user to determine the estimated financial gap a family is likely to have to cover.

How do we use it?

By estimating the financial gap between what a family at the median income in a ZIP code is able to pay and the tuition your school, you will have a better picture of how affordable your tuition is in your market.
