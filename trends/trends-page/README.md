[**In-app Guidance**\
If you prefer, we now offer an in-app self guided tour of the Trends page. Click here for that, or keep reading for a traditional walkthrough!](https://marketview.nais.org/trends?product\_tour\_id=428516)
{% endhint %}



## Getting started

When you first sign into Market View, you'll land on the **Trends Page.**

At the top of the page, you'll see some default settings. The **query paragraph** reads, "Showing data within: _30 minutes_ drive of my school at a _$27,950_ tuition level."

{% hint style="info" %}
$27,950 is the median tuition for NAIS schools, so we use it as the default tuition level.
{% endhint %}

In Market View, all charts, graphs, tables, and maps are customized for your school.

## Customize your query

* Customize the drive time query (choose a ten minute increment between 10-60 minutes)
* Customize the tuition level (input any dollar amount you'd like to research)
* Customize the geographical center point of the search. Market View has rich data for any US location. The location defaults to your school's address.&#x20;

To change the drive time query or the tuition level, click into those text fields and adjust. To change the geographic centerpoint of the query, click "Change" near the address in the upper right.

Or, feel free to proceed without any customization! This query paragraph will always be at the top of the page for you to experiment.

## Filter your data

Depending on where your school is, you may have a lot of ZIP codes in proximity. Market View lets you filter the data and focus on the most impactful areas. Click on the "**113 ZIP codes"** text and you'll see a list of all the ZIPs included in your search, as well as their neighborhood names.&#x20;

You can click on any ZIP in the list and Market View will bring you to a page with every data point we use for that ZIP.&#x20;

You can also search in the dropdown menu to find a specific ZIP or name.&#x20;

Click **"all"** to open a dropdown where you can select how many ZIPs you want to see.&#x20;

Click **"Distance".** You'll have the option of choosing distance, children, median income, or diversity.&#x20;

For instance, you can elect to display only the 20 closest ZIPs, or the 30 highest income ZIPs, etc.&#x20;

If you make selections using these filters, all other ZIPs will be hidden from the map and the data.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Don't be surprised to see a map with a lot of holes in it! The map below shows the thirty ZIPs (in blue) with the most children within an hour of the NAIS office.
