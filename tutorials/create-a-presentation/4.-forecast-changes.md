# 4. Forecast changes

Market View can help you identify trends for your local market. For example, let's say we wanted to look at affordability and race/ethnicity. We might want to show the **Change in Average Household Income by Race/Ethnicity** and **Change in School-Aged Population by Race/Ethnicity**.

At the end of this 5-minute tutorial, you will have artifacts like these two slides. These are just two examples of the trends you can look at in Market View.

## Looking at **Change in Average Household Income by Race/Ethnicity**

Let's first take a look at the Change in Average Household Income by Race/Ethnicity. We'll go to the **Affordability section** under the Trends tab in Market View.
