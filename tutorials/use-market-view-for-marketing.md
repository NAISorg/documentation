# Use Market View for marketing

## Online Marketing

[Instagram](https://business.instagram.com/blog/targeting-instagram-ads), [Google Adwords](https://support.google.com/searchads/answer/6259969?hl=en), [Facebook Ads](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/202297959811696), and others can use ZIP codes as parameters for audience selection. Sometimes you can further refine based on other parameters, such as income or psychographic data.

## Direct Mail

If you'd like to send physical mail to local addresses, you can pair Market View data with a tool from the Post Office called [Every Door Direct Mail.](https://www.usps.com/business/every-door-direct-mail.htm)

The Post Office will let you select individual postal routes to include. This is helpful especially if you have a bus stop nearby and you are looking for families with easy access to that bus stop.&#x20;
